# Util [![](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RoanH/Util.svg)](https://github.com/RoanH/Util/releases) 
Utilities for public projects. I mainly use this repository to implement features to all of my projects at the same time. You're free to use this as a dependency for your own project. Currently the most interesting feature is being able to use the modern style Windows file chooser that normally isn't available in Swing.
