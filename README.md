# Util
Utilities for public projects. I mainly use this repository to implement features to all of my projects at the same time. You're free to use this as a dependency for your own project.

### Gradle
```groovy
repositories{
	maven{
		url "https://jitpack.io"
	}
}

dependencies{
	implementation 'com.github.RoanH:Util:v1.2'
}
```
